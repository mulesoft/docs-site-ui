== Overview

Anypoint Data Gateway allows you to easily integrate data stored in legacy back-office systems with Salesforce. Data Gateway lets you access your data from within Salesforce itself, using a simple point-and-click visual interface to wield the full functionality of Salesforce on your external data.

Data Gateway supports integration with systems such as SAP, Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, and others. Connecting to these systems is instantaneous – just fill in the parameters such as host, user, etc., and you’re done. The ability to quickly connect with diverse back-office systems eliminates the need to create separate design environments, or to implement extensive training for Salesforce users.

== Using Data Gateway through your Anypoint Platform Account

If you own an Anypoint Platform account, and your user owns the appropriate entitlements, a Data Gateway link will be present in your https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform home page], and in the left navigation bar.

== Installing Data Gateway into Salesforce

Data Gateway is available as a Salesforce package which you install via https://appexchange.salesforce.com/[Salesforce AppExchange]. After you install the package, you can access the Data Gateway Designer, which allows you to quickly and easily create a new gateway to your desired external data source. After you've configured your gateway, you can publish it – make it available to the external entities that you specify – as well as see existing objects in your data source, and create new objects.

See xref:installing-anypoint-data-gateway.adoc[Installing Anypoint Data Gateway] for more details.

[NOTE]
Anypoint Data Gateway requires that your Salesforce account includes https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/platform_connect_about.htm[Salesforce Connect]. This is the feature that allows Salesforce to access and and modify data that resides outside of its own repositories.
