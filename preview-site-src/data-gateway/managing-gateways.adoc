=== Modifying a Gateway's Status

To modify the status of an existing gateway:

. Go to the gateway list in Gateway designer by clicking *Gateways* in the global left-hand menu.
. In the gateway list, locate the gateway you wish to modify, then click the *Edit* menu on the right.
+
image::modifying-gw-status-1_2.png[modifying_gw_status-1.2]
+

. Select from the available options: *Publish*, *Start*, *Delete* or *Settings*. This last option takes you to the Salesforce Settings configuration screen, described below.

=== Modifying Gateway Settings

To modify a gateway's settings (such as name and URL), click the gateway's *Edit* menu (see above), then select *Settings*. Alternatively, click the gateway in the gateway list, then click *Settings* in the left-hand menu. Gateway Designer displays the *Settings* screen for the gateway, shown below.

image::data-gateway-settings-menu.png[gw_settings-1.2]

When you're done, click *Save*.

==== Policies

You can apply a xref:api-manager::rate-limiting-and-throttling.adoc[Throttling] policy to your gateway if you wish.

==== Salesforce

All of your gateways are exposed to Salesforce through a unique external data source, consuming a single Lighting Connect license.

You can access the Salesforce settings menu by clicking the *Edit* button for a particular gateway, then selecting *Publish*, or by clicking in the Salesforce item in the left nav bar.

image::publish-1_2.png[publish-1.2]

To publish your Data Gateways, do the following:

. Select the Data Gateways to be published
. Click *Save*

[NOTE]
====
In previous versions of the Data Gateway, each Gateway was mapped to a Salesforce Connect license. Now, all of your Gateways are channeled through a single external data source, exposed through the OData API shown in this screen.

If you enter the settings of any individual gateway – by clicking *Edit* -> *Settings* – you will see a different URL for the endpoint that exposes it. This endpoint is not being used to sync up with Salesforce, but is still useful for connecting to other OData consumers.

=== Working with Objects

You can add, modify or delete objects in a gateway, and also <<copy,copy>> objects from one gateway to another.

To perform operations on objects,

To add, modify or delete objects in a gateway:

* Click the gateway in the list of gateways, or
* Click the gateway's *Edit* menu (see above), then select *Create Object*, or
* Click *Settings*, then click *Objects* in the left-hand menu

The Objects screen displays objects in the gateway. In the image below, gateway `MySQL thru AP` contains two objects, `gateways` and `users`.

image::add-object-1-1_2.png[add.object-1-1.2]

==== Creating a New Object

To add a new object to a gateway, click *Create Object*.

Data Gateway displays the *New Object* screen:

image::add-object-2-1_2.png[add.object-2-1.2]

In order to create an object, you need to:

. Choose the table where the object will reside.
. Specify a name for the object.
. Optionally describe the object.
. Select the fields for the object.

To select a table, you can search through the available tables list or type the full or partial name of a table in the search box. The string you type can be any part of the table, and is case sensitive.

image::add-object-3-1_2.png[add.object-3-1.2]

When you select a table, the field selector in the *Create an External Object* screen becomes populated with the table fields. Search for the desired fields using the search box. Then, select each individual field by clicking it, as shown below. To select all fields, click the empty checkbox by the *Name* column.

image::add-object-4-1_2.png[add.object-4-1.2]

The field that is assigned the primary key (`id` in the screenshot above) is marked as such by an icon. If the table does not have a primary key, you can assign one manually by hovering your mouse over the desired field, then clicking the key icon that appears next to the key name.

[NOTE]
Tables retrieved from SAP systems may display a *Description* column for some fields.

[TIP]
To toggle viewing only selected fields in a table, click the eye icon image:eye-icon-1_2.png[eye_icon-1.2] to the left of the search box.

After you have selected the table, object name and fields, click *Create Object* at bottom right of the screen.

==== Modifying an Existing Object

To modify an object in a gateway, click the object you wish to modify. Data Gateway displays the object properties screen, which allows you to modify the object.

This is the same screen used when <<Creating a New Object>>. The image below displays the configuration window for object `users` on gateway `MySQL thru AP`.

image::modif-object-1_2.png[Modify object]

[[copy]]
==== Copying an Object Between Gateways

Data Gateway allows you to copy an object from one gateway to another. This feature is specially useful when working with multiple environments that you wish to maintain in a similar state, such as a development and a production environment.

When copying an object, Data Gateway performs checks to ensure that the new object being created in the target gateway is valid. If the object does not exist in the target Gateway, it will be copied even if there are errors. Accessing each object with errors and fixing them is required to enable the copied object. On the other hand, if the object already exists in the target Gateway, and copying it means that the target object will have errors, Data Gateway refuses to perform the copy operation. For example, if the source object belongs to a database table that does not exist in the target gateway, or if there is a mismatch between existing fields, Data Gateway will report the errors, and will not copy the object.

To copy an object, follow these steps:

. Go to the _target_ gateway, i.e. the gateway that you wish to copy the object(s) to, and access the list of objects for the gateway. (For example, in the list of gateways, click the desired gateway, then click *Objects* in the left-hand menu).
. Click the down arrow next to *Create Object*, then select *Copy Objects From...*

image::copy-objs-menu.png[Copy Objects menu]

Data Gateway displays the *Copy Objects* screen. This screen allows you to select the _source_ gateway and object(s).

image::copy-objs-screen.png[Copy Objects screen]

[start=3]
. From the first drop-down menu, select the source environment, i.e. the environment to which your source gateway belongs. When you select a source environment, the source gateway drop-down menu (the second drop-down menu in the screen) loads a list of gateways valid for that environment, or displays a message if there are no valid gateways.
. Select a source gateway from the second drop-down menu.
. When you select a source gateway, the list of objects on the left becomes populated with the objects available on the source gateway. The number of fields in each object is displayed to the right. You can hover the mouse over an object to view a list of the fields in that object. Select the object(s) you wish to copy, then click *Copy Objects*.

If the object(s) you wish to copy already exist in the target gateway, Data Gateway prompts you to overwrite them, or to skip copying the object(s). If the copy operation completes without error, Data Gateway again displays the list of objects.

If the copy operation produces an error, Data Gateway does _not_ copy the object; instead, it displays an error message:

image::copy-error-msg.png[Object copy error message]

Whenever you encounter an error, you can track the trigger in the _logs_ tab, and filter per error.

image::copy-error-msg2.png[Object copy error message]


== Viewing Gateway Logs

To view the logs for a gateway, click the gateway in the list of gateways, then select *Logs* from the left-hand menu.

As you can see in the image below, the log for the gateway is displayed in a scrollable pane in the browser window. Using this log viewer, you can:

* Search for log entries using the search box above the log
* Select to display the last 100 (default), 200 or 500 log entries
* View entries for all log priorities (the default) or only for specific priorities such as `INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, etc.
* Download the log as a text file to your local machine

To download the log, use the download button image:download-icon-1_2.png[download_icon-1.2]  at top right.
