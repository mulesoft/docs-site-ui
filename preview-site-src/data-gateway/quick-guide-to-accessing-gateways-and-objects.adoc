== Overview

Once you have installed Anypoint™ Data Gateway – and performed the actions described in the *Post-Installation Steps* section of xref:installing-anypoint-data-gateway.adoc[Installing Anypoint Data Gateway] – you have two ways to access gateway and object information:

* xref:managing-gateways.adoc[Via Anypoint Gateway Designer]: This Salesforce application gives you full access to all gateways, whether published or not. Here you can create, modify or delete gateways and objects; and define global parameters such as VPC settings. In Gateway Designer, you can also publish or unpublish a gateway to Salesforce. Unpublished gateways are not visible in Salesforce. +

* Via Salesforce: Within your Salesforce account, you can view gateways and objects published in Salesforce. Access from Salesforce, however, is read-only; you can't delete a gateway or object from within Salesforce. For example, if you delete a gateway in Salesforce, it will continue to exist and be available in Gateway Designer, even though it is invisible in Salesforce (for details, see <<Accessing Gateways from Salesforce>>). +
Within Salesforce, you also configure the Gateway Designer application (for details, see <<Accessing Gateway Designer Application Information>>).

== Accessing Gateways from Gateway Designer

To access or modify your existing gateways, or to create a new gateway, access Anypoint Data Gateway Designer from within your Salesforce account.

Once you have xref:installing-anypoint-data-gateway.adoc[installed Anypoint Data Gateway], a new tab called *MuleSoft* will be created for you in Salesforce. Click this tab to go to the Gateway Designer, shown below.

In the Gateway Designer, you can:

* Modify existing gateways, or create new gateways
* Access and modify gateway objects
* View gateway logs
* View global notifications
* Define global settings, such as VPC parameters

For details on using Gateway Designer, see xref:managing-gateways.adoc[Managing Gateways].

== Accessing Gateways from Salesforce

From your Salesforce account, you can:

* Define parameters for Anypoint Gateway Designer
* View (but not modify) objects inside gateways
* View gateway information

=== Accessing Gateway and Object Information

To access gateway and object information, follow these steps:

. In Salesforce, click your user name on the top right, then select *Setup* from the drop-down menu.
. In the Setup menu from the left-hand pane, go to *Develop* -> *External Data Sources* or *External Objects*.

==== External Data Sources

Clicking *External Data Sources* as described above displays the gateways that have been published to Salesforce.

To edit information for the gateway, click *Edit*. To delete the gateway in Salesforce, click *Del*.

Whatever actions you take here affect the representation of the gateway in Salesforce, not the gateway itself. For example, deleting a gateway here causes it to be unpublished and unavailable in Salesforce, but the gateway still exists and is accessible via the Gateway Designer. To make it available in Salesforce again, publish the gateway once more.

==== External Objects

Clicking *External Objects* as described above displays the external objects in gateways that are accessible from Salesforce.

To edit information an object, click *Edit*. To erase the object in Salesforce, click *Erase*.

Whatever actions you take here affect the representation of the object in Salesforce, not the object itself. For example, deleting a object here causes it to be unpublished and unavailable in Salesforce, but the object still exists and is accessible via the Gateway Designer.
