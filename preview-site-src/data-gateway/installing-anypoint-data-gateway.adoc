The Anypoint™ Data Gateway can be installed as a Salesforce managed package, or accessed through the Anypoint Platform. For details on installing managed packages in Salesforce, see the https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=distribution_installing_packages.htm[official Salesforce documentation].

[TIP]
====
If you own an Anypoint Platform account, and your user owns the appropriate entitlements, a Data Gateway link will be present in the left nav bar within the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform]. You can use this UI directly, instead of following the instructions in this document for installing the Anypoint Data Gateway into your Salesforce account.
====

NOTE: Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are the only mechanism recommended to establish a connection between your company's network and the Anypoint Platform while using Anypoint Data Gateway.

== Prerequisites

To install Anypoint Data Gateway, you need:

* https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/platform_connect_about.htm[Salesforce Connect] activated as a feature.

This feature allows Salesforce to access and and modify data that resides outside of its own repositories.
* Available External Data Source licenses within Salesforce Connect.

Completing Data Gateway Setup requires VPC.
