[.lm-bold]##What Is API Management?##


API management is the process of creating, publishing, and overseeing application programming interfaces (APIs) in a secure and scalable environment.

API management helps ensure that APIs are reliable, secure, and easy to use, which can lead to better developer experiences and more successful applications.
