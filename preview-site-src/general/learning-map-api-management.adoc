:page-article-style: learning-map

API management on Anypoint Platform is a collection of new and existing products that accelerate application delivery and combat API sprawl by managing and securing any API, built and deployed anywhere. You can start anywhere in this end-to-end API lifecycle journey: design and build, discover, manage and secure, govern, and create engaging digital experiences.

[.lm-bold]##What Is API Management?##


API management is the process of creating, publishing, and overseeing application programming interfaces (APIs) in a secure and scalable environment.

API management helps ensure that APIs are reliable, secure, and easy to use, which can lead to better developer experiences and more successful applications.
