= Salesforce Connector
:page-component-name: salesforce-connector

The Salesforce connector enables you to create applications that react to Salesforce events such as adding, changing, or deleting objects, topics, documents, and channels.

The Anypoint Salesforce Connector lets you connect to the Salesforce APIs.
This connector exposes methods for accessing Salesforce, including working with the Salesforce Apex classes.

There are three ways to use a Salesforce connector in your application: as an outbound connector, an inbound connector, or a streaming inbound connector.

This connector works with the Salesforce SOAP API, REST API, Bulk API, and Streaming API, depending on the operation you configure.
Each API call uses an XML request and response over an HTTPS connection.
All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.
