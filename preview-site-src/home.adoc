Use Anypoint Platform to build a structured application network that connects applications, data, and devices with reusable APIs.

== Explore Anypoint Exchange

The APIs you build in MuleSoft to integrate applications and services are, by design, reusable and built with enterprise security in mind.
You can discover these APIs, as well as connectors, samples, and templates in
https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange^].

RAML fragments, custom packages, videos, links to documentation, and other assets are also available.

== Design and Build Integrations

Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based IDE that helps you create Mule apps and APIs, and Design Center is the cloud-based tool.
