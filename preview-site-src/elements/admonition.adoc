Admonitions created with the `NOTE:` shorthand:

NOTE: If you go into the basement, see if you can find Kenny's `parka`.

TIP: After someone sticks a fork in a socket, you'll need to reset the circuit in the dark basement.

WARNING: Never go into the basement.

CAUTION: Don't stick forks in electric sockets.

IMPORTANT: A monster lives in the basement.

Admonitions created with the longer `[NOTE]` syntax and paragraph wrapping (as it's caused differences in styling before):

[NOTE]
--
If you go into the basement, see if you can find Kenny's `parka`.
