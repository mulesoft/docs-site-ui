<1> Configure the `${apiName}` with the UUID, which is the group ID and the Exchange asset ID assigned to your API by API Manager.
<2> Configure the `${apiVersion}` with the API Version, which is the version name and the instance ID or the label assigned to your API by API Manager.
<3> Set the `flowRef` element to point to the flow that you want to pair to the API in API Manager.
<4> If you use APIKit and you would like to apply policies at a resource level, you must set this value. Otherwise said policies won't work at resource level.
